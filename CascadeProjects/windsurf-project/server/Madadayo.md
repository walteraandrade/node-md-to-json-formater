The last legacy that two elder Japaneses left to us, Hayakken Uchida-sensei and [[Kurosawa Akira]]-san. Usually I don't like to connect artistic stories to real life, like the artistic one being some kind of goal to reach in reality. But, usually, specially in Cinema, I need to put this out and accept that art can also be some sort of advice. This movie has two kind of advices: Hayakken's about how to love things in life, about how to not be afraid from your emotions, and for us, westerns, there is too many small things about society we should learn from the Japaneses, like the huge respect for the elders and their experience.

This movie reminds me of Hayao Miyazaki's pictures. There is no big special problem, there is no evil to defeat, there is no mystery to be revealed. It's simple about life itself, the problems that comes with it, the unexpected, the chaos coming from our order. All those things are so well constructed here that time don't seems to pass for the watcher, it's two hours and fourteen minutes of pleasure; aesthetic, intellectual and emotional pleasure.

Tatsuo Matsumura is doing a great job as the professor, he is incredibly charming and lovely with all his jokes, the simple way to look at life, the ability to deal with problems like thieves, or having his own house destroyed by the war... You can't help looking up to him. And you indeed feel like his students, being by hims side all over the film.

Kurosawa was, again, brilliant orchestrating all the good and bad times of this story with amazing musics, from Vivaldi (the four seasons' scene is specially wonderful) to popular Japanese songs that makes you cry easily.  
Like the last message Hyakken gives to the children in the film, the film itself it's the Kurosawa's message to us. The last scene he draw is beautiful. Nobody but him could end his own career that way. The ending makes you really want to say: "MADADAYO!, KUROSAWA"
