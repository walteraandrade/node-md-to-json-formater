_La Strada_, translated to English like _The Road_ and to Portuguese as the awful title of _Estrada da Vida_ (The Road of Life), was the fourth film from [[Frederico Fellini]]. In this film it's already clear to the audience some of the elements we would see in his most famous works: the circus, the [[symbolism]], the female importance and the originality of this incredible filmmaker who created a very personal style exactly when everyone around him was jumping in the [[Neo-Realism]] car.

Not that he was completely away from it. This film has some important neo-realistic characteristics, such as the out-doors scenarios and the raw portrayal of life.

_La Strada_ is almost a fairy-tale. Stereotyped characters, simple plot and moral convictions. However, it's this Fellini's young style the interesting part of it. The combination of both elements gave to this movie some kind of a familiar atmosphere that makes it praiseworthy for any audience.

It's a touching movie, filled with iconic characters and a absolutely charming [[Chaplin]]-like performance from Fellini's wife [[Giulietta Masina]].
