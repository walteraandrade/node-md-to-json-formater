_"I wanted to use cinema to speak of youth, or else I  
wanted to use youth to speak of cinema."_

[[Jean-Luc Godard]], about _Masculin, Féminin"_. _Les lettres_, June 1966

Impossible to describe better.

Every single time I watch a Godard film I get more and more involved by his ability to develop cinema in all sort of situations. In this particular one, as he said in the same interview I quoted above, he thought he was loosing his cinema and that he couldn't find it in the adults since the new generations "were people who had not been conditioned. Conditioned by their life, certainly, but not morally conditioned."

His attempt to depict the life on youngsters is the best part of the film. If you recall, the contraceptive methods were invented by that time - around the 60's. This [[sexual]] revolution is one of the themes they discuss. The role of women in society, the new freedom the contraceptive methods gave to them, the Vietnam war, and, of course, capitalism. This movie is great in every single part it forgets socialism. As a man, Paul, the main character, is a good character; but when the subject is politics, he is very annoying.

There are some special scenes that I absolutely loved, though. The first one, which I'll always remember, is when Elizabeth (the lovely [[Marlène Jobert]]) is talking to Paul's friend, the syndicalist. The major frame has her eating a apple, like she's some kind of Eva, very slowly, like she is afraid to bit it for real and talking about sex and men with some apprehension in her face. Awesome take. Also, the references to another movies were clever.

**"You are not Pierrot le Fou. He stole cars for his women."

Not to forget, the mention of [[Trauffaut]]'s work, specially _The 400 Blows_. _Masculin, féminin_ is, in some ways, an attempt to depict the youth that started with Doinel - Paul had just left the military service.

I've read around that some people criticized the existence of man characters being the intellectual ones and the girls being the silly and superficial ones; this may be true. But you can't forget that Elizabeth is a smart girl, he just doesn't like politics. There is another point of view who puts in first place the game with the words Masculin and Féminin. Whilst "masculin" has in its composition both words "masque" (mask) and "cul" (ass), the "féminin" starts with "f" and ends with "in", which together make "fin" (end). Since the last scene is about Paul's death and both girls talking about how life is going to be, the interpretation that this trick with the word "féminin" means that females had the final word is valid.

Without all that crap about communism that sometimes really pissed me off and I almost gave up watching it, the film is wonderful and really worth to watch once and maybe twice.
