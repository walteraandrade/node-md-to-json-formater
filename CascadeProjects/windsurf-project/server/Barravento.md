In Brazil there is some kind of cult to [[Glauber Rocha]] between Cinema lovers. I'm not one of those who thinks he was a genius or something, however, I do think he had a lot of talent.

In the 20's we started a artistic movement named "[[Modernism]]". Of course, this is not a singular event at all. When the 20th century came this kind of movement occurred all around the world. For me, the problem is that trying to create a "Brazilian way to make art" they felt in a "how to depict Brazilian culture with Europeans techniques" and that's what Glauber Rocha is: Brazilian culture (well) represented by Europeans ways.

I'm not one of those who thinks this is bad, though. European Cinema _is_ the best, so whats the problem on drinking on this source? Kurosawa did and he is still a genius.

"Barravento" is about [[tradition]] versus [[vanguard]].

In a peaceful village where they live only for fishing, an former villager whom went to the city to get a better life comes back and he brings with him a lot of "revolutionary" ideas. His ideas will face the old ways that have always dominated the head of the fishermen. Ideas about [[religion]], about submission, about independence, freedom. His ways to make the villagers understand and follow his ideas are questionable, sometimes even stupid and mean, but his intentions are good. Nevertheless, he'll need to face the elder villagers and the priests of the African religion that rules this village.

The great deal about this movie is that it seems to imply that all the fishermen should free their minds from the old ideas (and I the reason for me to believe that is that last frame with Aruã and his head getting involved by the infinity, or the sky) and to manage that, the films depicts this religion pejoratively. It is shown with the beauty of their song and dance (whose helped to create Samba), their beautiful clothes, their good intentions, but all the time as a primitive way of living. The idea of "religion is the opium of the people" is present in every sequence of this film and is depicted with passion.

Very influenced by Italian cinema (how to don't remember "[[Stromboli]]" fishing sequences?), film [[noir]] and also _Nouvelle Vague_, the images are beautiful and the lighting work is awesome.

It is a real Brazilian classic. With Europeans techniques, of course.
