Probably Godard's most personal film ever. Complex, intriguing and intelligent film about relationship, break down of language and problems between art and it's commercialization.

Seems like in 1962 [[Brigitte Bardot]] herself said that she wanted to work with Godard in a movie. Being Godard a filmmaker without this great commercial success, the participation of such actress could change it all. Indeed, Godard received a huge quantity of money from a American producer. In that time, Godard's relationship with Karina was collapsing. It was reported that he slapped her in a certain restaurant because she denied to dance with another guy. Also, due the participation of Bardot in the cast Godard was forced to do things he didn't wanted to.

Fortunately, the greatest proof of talent in some artist is when he uses his own problems to create something enjoyable for others.

Everything in _Contempt_ can be seen as a part of Godard's life. Michel Piccoli, who plays Paul, is wearing the same clothes than Godard. Also, seems like Godard asked to Bardot to walk like Karina and to wear some clothes that Karina used in _Vivre sa Vie_.

Oddly, this film has a straight-line narrative. Of course that the reason behind it is that it was a novel before Godard turns it into a screenplay. It begins with a post-filmed scene where Paul and Camile (Bardot) are talking in a inmost moment. This scene was not part of the original film, it was filmed to show some nudity from Bardot and so get some profit with the movie - producer's idea. Then, we understand that Paul needs money to pay the apartment he bought to live with Camile, and that this American producer wants he to write a screenplay for a [[Fritz Lang]] film. Even though Paul wanted to write things for theater, he feels like accepting because the producer pays well. The movie is an adaptation from [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]], and it will work as a mirror to the main story all the time.

The problems will start when Jeremy Prokosch ([[Jack Palance]]) asks to Camile to go in his Alfa-Romero to his house, for some reason (insecurity or super-security, hard to say), Paul tells her: "Go, go with him." It is also hard to say why she got mad. Probably she thinks he does not value her, or because she thought she was being sold. The psychological depth of this characters is awesome. Their lack of communication leads them to fight more and more, and to no longer love each other. Differently than _Vivre sa Vie_, in which the problems with communication are depicted in a rich conversation, this problems here are depicted with images. The different colors the characters uses, the different ways to move around (specially this detail with the unfinished door), and - of course - the broken dialogue between them, it all makes you feel uncomfortable and at the same time interested in what is going on.

The lack of communication can be seen too in the role of the translator. She hardly translated rightly what is said.

_Contempt_ is a mirror to any relationship, it is a great piece of art and a great [[existentialist]] confession from [[Jean-Luc Godard]].
