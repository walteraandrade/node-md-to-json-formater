I can't really say that I'm a sci-fi man because of movies like Blade Runner.

Although this is a good movie and all, some lack of artistic perception make this movie weak. To depict what I want to say, I'd quote [[Duncan Jones]]' _[[Moon]]_. For me, _Moon_ is a perfect example of how a sci-fi should work. It manages perfectly to elaborate human personality within a hypothetic but yet possible future. Otherwise, in _Blade Runner_, the desire that always follows [[Ridley Scott]]'s works to make a great profit from his films is bigger than his desire to create something artistic and truthful.

The scenarios are great, the cast is doing a great job, the music is so important that the film probably would suck without it, and the ideas behind the story are great. The problem is how the story is told. I should read _Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?_ to understand if the problem was the screenplay writers or the story itself. Let me explain it. First, Roy is a super intelligent replicant, right? He wants to live more and specially he wants Pris to live more. However, when he meets his creator and asks him for modifications that could make he live more and Tyrell gives a short answer of why he can't do that, Roy kills Tyrell. Question: if Tyrell is the genius and he is constantly researching, why Roy didn't ask him to research instead killing him? It does not seems like a smart choice for me. Even knowing he didn't have any time, the murderer couldn't do any better to it. The huge capacity of thinking on this replicants are always putted aside. Another example is when Derek finds Pris. They start to fight, she hits him and manages to lock him with her legs, somehow he manages to get free. What a intelligent being could do? I can't say for sure but I can say that a intelligent being would not jump around like it was in some kind of circus. Nevertheless, we are never aware of what Derek thinks about the whole situation; _"Replicants are like any other machine - they're either a benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem."_ is the only clue we have. In addition, we don't know the public opinion about the fact, nor how it was really affecting their lives.

A development in subjects such as killing a human instead a replicant, or the life time of replicants and humans, their relationship, the lack of control, possible ways of a peaceful relationship, all those subjects are taken aside to give space to action scenes and ephemeral dialogues.

Also, there is no explanation for why is Derek doing this job again. When the film begins, everything seems to show that he does not want to do this, and then Bryant insists and somehow blackmails Derek who finally accepts to do this. Why? I can't tell. In addition, there is no explanation of how the replicants started to have feeling. Both explanations could make the watcher feels closer to the characters and feel the film more intensely.

And I don't want to mention those vulgar metaphors of unicorn and the white pigeon.

But, still, I respect the idea. I just think Scott was the wrong guy for it.
