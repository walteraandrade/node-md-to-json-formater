[[Giuseppe Tornatore]]
Masterpiece. I can't believe I'm watching it just now. A beautiful, trustable, mature and exhilarating story surrounded by a harmonic work of [[photography]], the music from [[Ennio Morricone]] and lots of classical movies dancing around the screenplay like a beautiful needlework. I can't see how this movie could be better.

Just to show one of the reasons I'm so excited about this movie, this is one my favorite lines, when the blind and old man is talking to Salvatori, trying to teach him about life:

"_Once upon a time a king gave a party in which all the beautiful princess of the kingdom went to. A guarding soldier saw the king's daughters passing by. She was the most beautiful and he felt in love. But what possibly could this poor soldier do to the king's daughter? However, he met her and said he couldn't live without her. The princess was so touched by that strong feeling that she told the soldier: 'If you wait for 100 days and 100 nights under my window, I'll be yours.' The soldier walked straight to there and waited. A day. Two. Ten days, twenty... And every day the princess watched by the window but the soldier never moved. The rain could come, the snow, the wind and he stand. The birds dirtied his head, the bees ate him alive and he didn't move. After 90 days he was thin and pale and he couldn't hold the tears because not even forces to sleep he had. However, the princess was watching, and in the 99ª day the soldier rises, got his chair and walked away._"

Of course, this kind of tale is common. Even [[Nietzsche]] talked about that. The woman as a game that we, men, like to play and while this game is happening, we love it. But when she's finally ours, the game is over and we don't want to play it anymore. Well, for me it's not only non-sense as its superficial, psychologically speaking. But the great thing is that this movies gives an answer to that question, an answer I couldn't find by my own experiences. Some time after the scene when this story is told, Salvatori comes with an answer to that, after he experienced himself the waiting for a woman. He says:

_"Now I understand why the soldier walked away right in the end. Yes, one more night and she would belong to him, but there was the possibility that she could give up that promise. And this would be awful. He could die. At least, for 99 nights he could live hoping she was waiting for him"_

Now we have a respectable answer for the question I've been asking myself for months! Movies shouldn't be the answer for our questions, or shouldn't be an example for our lives. Maybe an escape for our daily problems, maybe a aesthetic game to make you laugh, cry, think about technical achievements... But sometimes it is capable to make it all and still give you strength to get over some problems, and [[Cinema Paradiso]] did it for me. This is now one of my top 5.
