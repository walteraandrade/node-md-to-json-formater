I have to tell that I was quite afraid of rewatching it. In the first time I saw it, I really liked but I was so sleepy that I couldn't understand this film completely. (Also, I thought the Chinese were all the same and mixed it up, lol).

Well, I'm happy I've decided to watch it again because I can say for sure that this is one of the finest dramas about love ever.

Now, lets get to the film. What is the essence of the film?

Let's assume you're with a woman. You're chatting, you find out that she likes _2001: A Space Odyssey_ as much as you do and also hated Aang in [[M. Night Shyamalan]]='s _The Last Airbender_ (in fact, she says, Shyamalan's career is going straight down last years). The atmosphere is good, you two have a lot in common. Now, she also slopes her head a little bit to you. Obviously, she's trying to make you kiss her. However, you aren't sure about this, this might be your head thinking to much. What if it isn't?

This is the moment [[Wong Kar-Wai]] calls in the mood for love.

If you ever try to remember one scene like these in your past, you'll find one. You'll remember that they are often very contemplative, _like slow shots_.

_In the Mood for Love_ portrays this climax of the seduction all around the film, using a slow camera that often stares at apparently useless objects or parts of the body. Most part of the time, the camera is placed in a medium distance from the character, suggesting more than showing. That, combined with this heartbreaking Tango that plays all around the film and that beautiful Bolero sung by Nat King Cole is simply stunning.

So, basically, stylish details apart, the movie is about a man (Mr. Chow) that innocently moves to a certain building in Hong Kong with his wife; and a woman (Mrs. Chan) that is also moving to this same building with her husband; although in different apartments. Soon they'll find out that Mr. Chow's wife is betraying him with with Mr. Chan. From this tragic discovery will born a complex fellowship. However, from this fellowship, in both lonely hearts love will start to burn and they'll have to deal with it. Somehow. Moral codes will come up, the Chinese paternalistic society will try to spoil it, their own consciousness will drive them crazy.

Therefore, the movie is, basically, an amazing aesthetic exercise of the most fiery moment of [[seduction]]. And Wong Kar-Wai did it more than rightly.
