A very good and popular review in Letterboxd, if I'm not mistaken it's about _The Tree of Life_ says that there is a [[Malick]] gene somewhere and it makes some people absolutely love him and other people don't. Well, I'm sorry but I have to disagree. Unless this gene is the one who control one's intelligence, this is no acceptable explanation. Malick likes to make you think. He raises more questions than answers. He is not going to entertain you - he is no joker. He is not perfect, indeed, but if you say his films are boring, it's because you should be watching the new _Two and a Half Men_, you're no audience for him.

An interesting and significant detail about Malick's biography is that he first wanted to become a philosopher and even graduated in Philosophy and started a PhD, but he gave up to start working with films. His work was mainly focused on Martin Heidegger's philosophy. Although Heidegger's most famous work are about the essence of being and some other ontological themes - which can also be found in Malick's films - it is very important how Heidegger's thoughts about art are visible in Malick's canon, specially the essence of the artistic image. For example, in his book _The Origin of the Work of Art_, he explains how [[Van Gogh]]'s [[A Pair of Shoes]] is a great work of art due it's semantic autonomy. For example: we can look at this figure and we know at once that this is a pair of shoes of a man who walks a lot; probably in some farm. The relationship between this simple object and the enormous quantity of thought we might have about it is very important in Heidegger's view of art, it is, essentially, not a shoe but instead the representation of a shoe. It is the simplicity of this shoe and it's multiple meanings, stories etc.

If you start watching this movie knowing that Malick wants to make you contemplate each image as you would contemplate this pair of shoes, you're going in the right way. But as the cinematic language is pretty different from the paintings, of course. Here, the images are completed not by themselves but instead with voice-overs of soldiers talking about life and death. Also, there is an interesting work of decoupage which fills every image with the next one. The film is filled with paradoxical themes such as theism and atheism, solidarity and egoism, war and peace, leadership and cowardice, etc. All of them very well represented by each image, each dialogue. Each plant, each bullet, each fire, each blow of the wind in the grass.

If you don't like Malick, sorry to say but you don't like art. Lucky you the new outsider's addiction are these series where you don't need to think to understand.
