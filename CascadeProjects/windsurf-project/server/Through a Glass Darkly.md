This must be the third or fourth time I watch [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s _Through a Glass Darkly_ and it still holds up as one of the best films I've ever seen.

Bergman's objective here was clear since the first frame after the credits, as they are walking out of the sea, they'll leave darkness and try to find their paths. Every single one of them has a particular point that needs to be freed. The first, obviously, is Karin ([[Harriet Andersson]]; when the movie begins, she had been recently freed from the hospital due some mental problems. This problem is never explicated, all we know is that it's almost incurable and she is still under treatment. This problem is apparently connected with desire, personal beliefs and guilt. Seems like she has some similarities with Bergman's mother, - whose name was also Karin - and to whom he gave the following description: "She was a little bossy. She liked to give orders." Just the same thing they say about Karin in the beginning.

The second one is Minus, Karin's brother. In short, a teenager. Minus' hormones are exploding, he breaths sexuality and insecurity. He's in the border between childhood and [[maturity]] although he can only see maturity in a far horizon. Also, he feels the lack of a paternal image since his father is traveling all the time.

David ([[Gunnar Björnstrand]]), the father, the third character in my list, is a completely egoist man. This is told in the beginning of the movie and is proved in the middle of it. He is the character to whom I feel closer He does not denies his egoism, he tries to understand egoism as a form of love as well even though he does not know what it means.

The last one is Martin ([[Max von Sidow]]), Karin's husband. He is the very representation of love in many ways. He had all the excuses to abandon Karin and move on with his life; apparently he is a well-succeeded doctor, a handsome and careful man. However, his decision is to stay by Karin's side and help her in her treatment. He seems to be the only one who really believe in the possibility of cure. His necessity seems to be Karin's freedom. He is arrested because he can't cure Karin nor comfort her.

These are the characters and their path will take you to the debate about God's existence. Bergman himself told this movie was the frontier between his [[Christianity]] and posterior [[skepticism]]. Karin's disease, from this point of view, might be seen as the fear from [[sin]], when she's alone she express a vigorous [[sexuality]] that she has been hiding from her husband. The paradox between human desire and sin is the key to understand this film.

I don't need to talk about the cast. C'ome on! Every one who is nearly familiar with Bergman's work know about these actors. The only thing I'll left for the record is that Harriet Andersson's performance in this movie is one of the bests performances ever. In the whole film history, period.

The gorgeous cinematography from one of the best directors of photography in cinema history will interchange between light and shadow following the character's paths of freedom. Every time they'll talk about a hidden and dark secret they walk into some illuminated spot, using opened doors and windows around the house. [[Sven Nykvist]].

The music is... is... indescribable. It's [[Bach]]. Played in a cello. The cello in known as the instrument whose timbre is more close to the human voice. Every time the cello starts playing we can hear a human crying.

_Through a Glass Darkly_ is assuredly a masterpiece. One of my favorite movies all time.
